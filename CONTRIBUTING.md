# Contributing to Natural Language Processing Laboratory - SPPU

üí¨ Thank you for your interest in contributing to the NLP Lab repository! üí¨

We welcome contributions from students, NLP enthusiasts, and anyone passionate about making computers understand human language. Your help is invaluable in improving this resource for everyone.

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to this project.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute:

*   **üêõ Reporting Bugs or Issues:** If you find an error in an implementation, a problem with a dataset link, a typo in the documentation, or any issue with a practical setup, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kunalPisolkar24/NLP_Lab/issues) on GitHub.
    *   Clearly describe the issue.
    *   Include steps to reproduce it if it's a bug in the code.
    *   Specify the practical number or file(s) involved.
*   **‚ú® Suggesting Enhancements or New Examples:** Have an idea for improving an existing practical (e.g., using a different library, a more advanced technique, a new dataset), or suggesting a new relevant NLP task? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/kunalPisolkar24/NLP_Lab/issues) to discuss it first.
*   **üìù Improving Documentation:** If you find any part of the READMEs (main or for individual practicals) unclear, or think they could be improved with more detail or better explanations, your suggestions or pull requests are welcome.
*   **üíª Code Contributions (Pull Requests):** If you've fixed a bug, implemented an enhancement, added a new NLP technique, or improved an existing implementation, we'd love to see your pull request!

## Making Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

To contribute code, please follow these general steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [NLP_Lab repository page](https://github.com/kunalPisolkar24/NLP_Lab). This creates your personal copy of the project.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NLP_Lab.git
    cd NLP_Lab
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

3.  **Create a New Branch:**
    Create a descriptive branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    # For a new feature, model, or technique
    git checkout -b feature/your-nlp-feature-name

    # For a bug fix or correction
    git checkout -b fix/description-of-nlp-fix
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:**
    *   Implement your fix, new feature, or improvement.
    *   Ensure your code is clear, well-commented, and follows Python best practices (e.g., PEP 8).
    *   If working on a specific practical, keep changes within its directory (e.g., `Practical_1/`, `Practical_4_Transformer/`).
    *   **Test your changes thoroughly.** For NLP tasks, this means ensuring your code runs, produces the expected linguistic outputs (e.g., correct tokens, embeddings, model predictions), and doesn't introduce regressions.
    *   If you're using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, try to adhere to common best practices and ensure dependencies are clear.

5.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    Write clear and concise commit messages:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add MWE tokenizer example to Practical 1"
    # or
    git commit -m "fix: Correct TF-IDF calculation in Practical 2"
    # or
    git commit -m "docs: Update dataset link for Practical 3"
    # or
    git commit -m "refactor: Improve attention mechanism in Transformer (Practical 4)"
    ```

6.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    Push your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-nlp-feature-name
    ```

7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the original `kunalPisolkar24/NLP_Lab` repository on GitHub.
    *   A prompt to "Compare & pull request" for your recently pushed branch should appear. Click it.
    *   If not, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request." Select your fork and branch to compare with the original `main` branch.
    *   **Fill out the PR template:**
        *   Use a clear and descriptive title.
        *   Explain the changes and their purpose in the description.
        *   If your PR addresses an issue, link it (e.g., `Closes #issue_number`).

## Pull Request Guidelines

To help us review your PR efficiently:

*   **Clear Purpose:** Your PR should address a specific issue or add a well-defined feature.
*   **Descriptive Content:** Provide a good title and description for your PR.
*   **Working Code:** Ensure your code runs and achieves its intended linguistic processing purpose.
*   **Readability:** Write clean, well-commented Python code.
*   **Focused Changes:** Prefer smaller, focused PRs over large, multi-purpose ones.
*   **Dependencies:** If you add new libraries, mention them and consider if a `requirements.txt` update is needed.

## Code Style

*   Primarily follow **PEP 8** for Python code.
*   Write readable code with good comments, especially for complex NLP algorithms or model architectures.
*   Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

## Questions or Discussions

If you're unsure about anything or want to discuss a potential contribution before starting work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kunalPisolkar24/NLP_Lab/issues) and tag the repository maintainer (`@kunalPisolkar24`).
