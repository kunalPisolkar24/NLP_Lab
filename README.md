üíª **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Text Preprocessing Basics (NLTK):** <br> Perform tokenization (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE), stemming (Porter, Snowball), and lemmatization using the NLTK library on sample sentences. |
| 2 | **Text Representation Techniques:** <br> Implement Bag-of-Words (count occurrence, normalized count), TF-IDF, and create word embeddings using Word2Vec. <br> *Dataset:* [Car Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset) |
| 3 | **Advanced Text Preprocessing & TF-IDF:** <br> Perform text cleaning, lemmatization, stop word removal, and label encoding. Create text representations using TF-IDF and save the outputs. <br> *Dataset:* [News Dataset (Pickle)](https://github.com/PICT-NLP/BE-NLP-Elective/blob/main/3-Preprocessing/News_dataset.pickle) |
| 4 | **Transformer from Scratch (PyTorch):** <br> Implement a basic Transformer model from scratch using the PyTorch library. |
